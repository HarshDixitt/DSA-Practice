2D ARRAYS ->

A two dimensional structure containing rows and columns it is known as 2D Array.


DECLARATION OF 2D ARRAY ->

int arr[rows][columns];

for instance,   int arr[5][7];
                int arr[3][2];


INITIALIZATION OF 2D ARRAYS ->

int arr[3][4] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};


ACCESS OF ELEMENTS ->  arr[i][j]


BEHIND THE SCENE IN 2D ARRAY -> 

There is no allocation of 2D space in memory for 2D arrays.
They are just like linear arrayvin continous memory blocks.



MAPPING OF 1D ARRAY IN MEMORY IS DONE BY USING FORMULA ->

c Ã— i + j


c is columns total
i is row index
j is column index


NOTE: when an array i.e 2D is initialized , it is mandatory 
      to give the size of columns bcz mapping of 2D array in 
      linear arrays requires size of columns.

      Also when 2D array is passed , the size of columns
      must be told.

      Its optional to give the size of rows in 2D array.
